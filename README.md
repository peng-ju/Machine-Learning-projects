# Projects of Machine Learning

### Higgs Boson
> Build a classifier to distinguish Higgs Boson signal from the background. The data is from 'https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson'.
> - Achieved AUC = 0.9 with XGB classifier.

### Map NN to FPGA (Fast Machine Learning)
> Create a DNN model for Higgs Boson classification with AUC = 0.92.  
> Convert the DNN model into HLS project usinig hls4ml.  
> Quantization aware pruning with QKeras.
