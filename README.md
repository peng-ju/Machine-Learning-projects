### Higgs Boson
> - Built a classifier to distinguish Higgs Boson signal from the background. The data is from 'https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson'.
> - Achieved AUC = 0.9 with XGB classifier.

### Map NN to FPGA (Fast Machine Learning)
> - Created a DNN model for Higgs Boson classification with AUC = 0.92.  
> - Converted the DNN model into HLS project usinig hls4ml.  
> - Quantization aware pruning with QKeras.
